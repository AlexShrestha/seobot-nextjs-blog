# [SeoBot](https://seobotai.com) Blog API for Next.js Website

## Overview

Elevate your Next.js website by integrating SeoBot's Blog API. This setup allows you to fetch and render real-time, SEO-optimized blog content directly into your website.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- SeoBot API Key (you can find it in your website settings on [app.seobotai.com](https://app.seobotai.com))

## Environment Setup

First, set up your environment variables. Create a `.env.local` file for local development:

```bash
WEBSITE_HOST=<your_website_host>
SEOBOT_API_KEY=<your_seobot_key>
```

## Running the Development Server

Execute one of the following commands to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Once the server is running, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Postman API Workspace

To test the SeoBot Blog API, you can use our [Postman API Workspace](https://www.postman.com/seobotai/workspace/seobotai-com/overview). This workspace includes pre-configured requests for the API.

## Editing the Blog Design

You can begin customizing your blog design by editing the files under the `app/blog/` route. Your changes will be automatically reflected in the app thanks to Next.js's hot reloading feature.
